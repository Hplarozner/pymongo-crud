# CRUD Operations with Python, MongoDB, Nuxt 3, and Vuetify

This repository is a full-stack project demonstrating CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The backend is built using Python with MongoDB as the database, while the frontend utilizes Nuxt 3 and Vuetify for a modern, responsive UI.

## Features

- **Backend**: Python and MongoDB for database operations.
- **Frontend**: Nuxt 3 for server-side rendering, Vue.js components, and Vuetify for material design UI.
- **Full CRUD**: Implemented for seamless data management.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring a great user experience on all devices.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up the backend**:
   - Ensure you have Python installed.
   - Create and activate a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
     ```
   - Install the necessary Python packages:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Set up a MongoDB database.
   - Configure your database connection in the Python backend.

4. **Start the backend**:
   Before running the backend, make sure your virtual environment is activated, then start the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Start the frontend development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Scripts

The following scripts are available to manage the project:

- **`npm run build`**: Build the Nuxt 3 application for production.
- **`npm run dev`**: Start the development server with hot-reloading.
- **`npm run generate`**: Generate a static version of the Nuxt 3 application.
- **`npm run preview`**: Preview the production build locally.
- **`npm run postinstall`**: Run after dependencies are installed to prepare the Nuxt environment.

## Usage

After setting up the project, you can access the application at `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. The backend will handle CRUD operations with MongoDB, and the frontend will provide an interactive UI using Vuetify.
